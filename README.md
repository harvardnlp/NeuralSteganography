# STEGASURAS
STEGanography via Arithmetic coding and Strong neURAl modelS

This repository contains implementations of the steganography algorithms from ["Neural Linguistic Steganography," Zachary M. Ziegler*, Yuntian Deng*, Alexander M. Rush](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01496).

There is a breaking change in pytorch 1.2, make sure to use pytorch 1.0 as in requirements.txt.

## Online Demo

Our online demo can be found at [https://steganography.live/](https://steganography.live/).

## Language model

Experiments in the paper use the medium (345M parameter) GPT model via [pytorch_transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers). For compute reasons the default in this code base is the small version but the medium or large versions can be used by changing the `model_name` parameter of `get_model`.

## Algorithms

The steganography algorithms implemented are:
1. Our proposed arithmetic coding-based algorithm
2. The Huffman algorithm from [RNN-Stega: Linguistic Steganography Based on Recurrent Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8470163)
3. The binning algorithm from [Generating Steganographic Text with LSTMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10742)

An example of encoding and decoding a message is in `run_single.py`. The algorithm used is determined by the `mode` parameter.
